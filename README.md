# Tufte Arsclassica


A Latex template inspired by [Aaron Thuron's
thesis](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/thesis.pdf) which combines the
`tufte` layout and `arsclassica` typography.

All the changes to the `tufte` package are located in the `tufte-common-local.tex` file, following `tufte` template conventions.

This repo contains slightly changed sources for `book` and `handout`
templates that illustrate some of the new features.

## Features

- [x] Large chapter title numbers.
- [x] SmallCaps section titles.
- [x] Aligned section titles when using numbering sections.
- [x] Aligned subsection titles when using numbering sections.
- [ ] Chapter title decorations (underline, etc.).
- [ ] `\newthought` visual marker.
- [ ] Typography? Still experimenting.
